# Techco-Data-Wrangling
During my graduate-level data analytics course INFO 570, I was presented with the opportunity to conduct an insightful case study on employee retention for a major technology company, which I'll refer to as TechCo. As someone pursuing a career in data analytics, I saw this project as an excellent chance to develop my skills in data wrangling, analytics, and predictive modeling.

I worked with TechCo's human resources data. After loading the data into a Jupyter Notebook using Pandas, I performed initial exploratory analyses and data cleaning steps such as outlier filtering and category encoding. Visualizations of key trends were generated through Matplotlib and Seaborn.

To develop predictive models, I tested popular algorithms available through Scikit-learn, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and random forest. I evaluated each technique's performance on held-out validation data to determine the most accurate. Through this process, random forest regression emerged as the top-performing technique for the binary classification task.

Further random forest feature importance analysis aided model interpretation. Two significant predictors were identified - employee performance reviews and tenure at the company. The model showed positive annual reviews and surpassing the one to two year mark made employees more likely to stay longer term.

In summary, this case study allowed me to apply the Python data science stack end-to-end and demonstrate proficiency in the entire machine learning workflow. The experience highlighted my ability to glean actionable insights from complex datasets using tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and clearly communicate technical results to business stakeholders.
